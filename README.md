# Challenge Description The Roche Data Science Coalition (RDSC) is requesting the collaborative effort of the AI community to fight COVID-19. This challenge presents a curated collection of datasets from 20 global sources and asks you to model solutions to key questions that were developed and evaluated by a global frontline of healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers.

# Dataset Description This dataset is composed of a curated collection of over 200 publicly available COVID-19 related datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins, the WHO, the World Bank, the New York Times, and many others. It includes data on a wide variety of potentially powerful statistics and indicators, like local and national infection rates, global social distancing policies, geospatial data on movement of people, and more.

# Challenge Details The tasks associated with this dataset were developed and evaluated by global front line healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers. They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impact in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management. To participate in this challenge, review the research questions posed in the dataset tasks and submit solutions in the form of Kaggle Notebooks.

We encourage participants to use the presented data and if needed, their own proprietary and non-proprietary datasets to create their submissions.
